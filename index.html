    <p>Dear Raquel,</p>

    <p>I hope this finds you in good health. You’ve remained in my best wishes and hopes. I want to quickly say that if I don’t talk to you again by the 30th, I wish you an amazing birthday. I have no clear intent or goal in giving you this letter—I simply want you to read these words. Every claim and feeling I posit is genuine and made with the furthest extent of my knowledge and awareness.</p>

    <p>Firstly, I love you. And I miss you. These past few days have been extremely difficult to navigate. There’s a massive hole in my heart where, once, you fit perfectly. I’ve wept gallons of tears behind closed doors and to my loved ones. There’s no greater yearning in the universe than what I’ve felt these past few days. I’ll probably ramble later on about it more.</p>

    <p>I just think I’m confused. I completely understand what has happened between us in the past, but hearing that you hated me so bluntly has been hurting me. I wanted to believe you when you said you simply didn’t want to be in the relationship, but why does that warrant hating me “so much”? That’s what makes it difficult for me to fully grasp how it could’ve unfolded. Sunday morning has replayed in my mind over and over and still I’m just so confused and split. I don’t know if I want closure, a discussion, or to try again. You know me—you know that if you ever opened your arms again I’d run right back, but I don’t know if that’s good for me. Blocking you was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made, and though it’s only been a few days I’m unsure if it was the right choice. I wish we could’ve talked. I wish I could’ve gone back in time and waited for your response to why you hated me. I wish for many things. In any world without you I’d always wish for you back. I’m trying to mature, I’m trying to heal, and I’m trying to figure everything out. Deep down, though, my answer was and will always be you.</p>

    <p>I’m trying to imagine a future without you but it’s hard. I’ve been talking to my loved ones about it—not extensively, but enough. We really had everything mapped out: college life, children, career, housing—everything. We shared political views, goals, preferences; I could keep listing. I just can’t imagine anyone more perfect than you. What I wanted more than anything was to follow in your footsteps because it felt comforting. I found it easy to ask you questions and be generally unaware—you never judged me for not knowing something or being confused.</p>

    <p>I fear that I’ll never get another conversation or perhaps even a word from you, so I want to ensure this fully encapsulates all the ideas and emotions I need to convey.</p>

    <p>On the day I lost you, it felt like the world was ending. I didn’t talk to anyone beside my mom for days. I realized how closely you’d crept into the deepest parts of my life—it made me so sad. My mom was washing my sheets and mentioned a random “pink stain.” I was confused until I realized it was from your hair dye, and my heart dropped. It’s those little things that have been eating away at me.</p>

    <p>I’ve had a lot of trouble sleeping and finding comfort within myself. That night, I cleaned my room and put many of your things in my dresser. I couldn’t get comfortable and had to pull Waffle back out and put him on the opposite side of the bed—I wondered if he still smelled like you. I still have a lot of your stuff: your belly-button piercing, hair ties, bobby pins, etc. I can bring any or all of it to you—no-contact, if you wish.</p>

    <p>I’m trying to act realistically, so again, I’m treating this like my last ever collection of words to you. I hope, Raquel, that you never lower the bar. I know you don’t need me to tell you, but you are the most beautiful, intelligent, witty, brave, funny, kind, generous, and jaw-dropping woman I’ve ever met. There’s not a part of you I don’t believe is perfect, and I’m wildly in love with every last bit of you. Please never lower the bar—I don’t want our relationship to make you feel you deserve less than you expect. I also want to apologize: I was lazy as a partner. I didn’t have much time after bringing it up to make it right, but I should’ve worked harder. I should have gotten you more flowers, taken you out to dinner more, and been more creative with our dates. There’s so much I wish I could change. Normally I’d say I don’t want this letter to be too much, but this time I’m just going to list everything.</p>

    <p>I have so many regrets. All of the horrible things I said to you make me sick to my stomach. All the times I was stingy, annoying, or ignorant—I regret them all. I regret blocking you, wholeheartedly. The more I type this, the more I believe it. I wish this could’ve been a conversation rather than a desperate plea on a page. I wish I’d been better with words in the moment instead of relying on a doc after the damage was done. I feel foolish. I miss you so much—your words, your presence, your voice, your everything.</p>

    <p>I truly and wholeheartedly wish your future endeavors go exactly to the beat of your heart. I wish I could’ve been there to help you with all the stressful college things. Regardless, I hope the entire process goes well. I believe in you and your plan. Wherever I end up, I’ll still wonder what you’re doing: whether you took that rhetoric class, tried Cheese Board, or rode the train every other weekend. I would’ve done anything to navigate long distance with you. I still would.</p>

    <p>But, man, I’m trying to keep this as unemotional and mature as possible—and it’s impossible. Everywhere I go I see pieces of you. Good lord, I miss you so much.</p>

    <p>If it’s the last thing I tell you, I love you. I love you so desperately I don’t know what to do with myself. I’ve been lost without you to show me the way. I don’t believe in “another universe”—I want you in this one, and I’m willing to do whatever it takes to prove it.</p>

    <p>I want to thank you. Thank you for redefining my perception of love. Thank you for sticking with me through difficult times. Thank you for showing me what true comfort feels like. Thank you for letting me meet your family. Thank you for being my girlfriend—and my best friend. If I could relive our time together, I would, so many times. I can’t describe how much I’ll miss you. I’m weak without you, Raquel. I plead like a lost lamb when you’re not here to ground me.</p>

    <p>This is my last act of love. I’ll leave you alone—whatever you wish—but please know I still love you, yearn for you, and ache for you. Blocking you and deactivating socials was overwhelming; I’m sorry. I’ll leave you alone, but I also want you to find me. I want us to be one again. Please, find me somewhere, sometime, and just talk to me. I’ll leave you alone, but remember: I will always love you, no matter what.</p>

    <p>Sincerely,<br>Ayden</p>
